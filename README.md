# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis
This is a Machine Learning Project using NLP (Natural Language Processing) with Restaurant reviews and analyzing the text data to finally perform sentiment analysis using Text classification.

## Aim
The aim of this analysis is to build a prediction model to predict whether a review on the restaurant is positive or negative. To do so, I worked on Restaurant Review dataset , and loaded it into predicitve algorithms Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. Towards the end I tried to find the "best" model for predicting the review's sentiment.

Dataset: Restaurant_Reviews.tsv is a dataset from Kaggle datasets which consists of 1000 reviews on a restaurant.

### Steps
To build a model to predict if review is positive or negative, following steps are performed.

-Importing Dataset

-Reviews Analysis

-Preprocessing Dataset

-Vectorization

-Training and Classification

-Analysis Conclusion

-Saving the best model
